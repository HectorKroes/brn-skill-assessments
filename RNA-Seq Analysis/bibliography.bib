	abstract = {We compare methods for filtering RNA-seq lowexpression genes and investigate the effect of filtering on detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Although RNA-seq technology has improved the dynamic range of gene expression quantification, low-expression genes may be indistinguishable from sampling noise. The presence of noisy, low-expression genes can decrease the sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus, identification and filtering of these low-expression genes may improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the SEQC benchmark dataset, we investigate the effect of different filtering methods on DEG detection sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect of RNA-seq pipelines on optimal filtering thresholds. Results indicate that the filtering threshold that maximizes the total number of DEGs closely corresponds to the threshold that maximizes DEG detection sensitivity. Transcriptome reference annotation, expression quantification method, and DEG detection method are statistically significant RNA-seq pipeline factors that affect the optimal filtering threshold.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition which is characterized by irreversible airway obstruction due to narrowing of small airways, bronchiolitis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma, emphysema. It is the fourth most common cause of mortality in the world and is expected to be the third most common cause of death by 2020. The main cause of COPD is smoking but other exposures may be of importance. Exposure leads to airway inflammation in which a variety of cells are involved. Besides neutrophil granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, airway epithelial cells are also of particular importance in the inflammatory process and in the development of emphysema. Cell trafficking orchestrated by chemokines and other chamoattractants, the proteinase–antiproteinase system, oxidative stress and airway remodelling are central processes associated with the development of COPD. Recently systemic effects of COPD have attracted attention and the importance of systemic inflammation has been recognized. This seems to have direct therapeutic implications as treatment with inhaled glucocorticosteroids has been shown to influence mortality. The increasing body of knowledge regarding the inflammatory mechanism in COPD will most likely have implications for future therapy and new drugs, specifically aimed at interaction with the inflammatory processes, are currently being developed.},

	abstract = {The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) comprise a family of at least 20 proteolytic enzymes that play an essential role in tissue remodeling. MMP1 (interstitial collagenase), MMP9 (gelatinase B) and MMP12 (macrophage elastase) are thought to be important in the development of emphysema. A number of naturally occurring polymorphisms of human MMP gene promoters have been identified and found to alter transcriptional activity. Additionally, we detected a novel polymorphism in the MMP12 coding region (Asn357Ser). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MMP polymorphisms in the development of chronic obstructive lung disease. We determined the prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers chosen from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, Lung Health Study for having the fastest (n = 284) and slowest (n = 306) 5 year rate of decline of lung function. Of the five polymorphisms, only G–1607GG was associated with a rate of decline in lung function. The –1607GG allele was negatively associated with a fast rate of decline (P = 0.02). However, haplotypes consisting of alleles from the MMP1 G–1607GG and MMP12 Asn357Ser polymorphisms were associated with rate of decline of lung function (P = 0.0007). These data suggest that polymorphisms in the MMP1 and MMP12 genes, but not MMP9, are either causative factors in smoking-related lung injury or are in linkage disequilibrium with causative polymorphisms.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial prohibitin (PHB) proteins have diverse functions, such as the regulation of apoptosis and the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. In this study, we clarified a novel mitochondrial function of PHB1 that regulates the organization and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In PHB1-knockdown cells, we found that mtDNA is not stained by fluorescent dyes, such as ethidium bromide and PicoGreen, although the mitochondrial membrane potential still maintains. We also demonstrated that mtDNA, which is predominantly found in the NP-40-insoluble fraction when isolated from normal mitochondria, is partially released into the soluble fraction when isolated from PHB1-knockdown cells, indicating that the organization of the mitochondrial nucleoids has been altered. Furthermore, we found that PHB1 regulates copy number of mtDNA by stabilizing TFAM protein, a known protein component of the mitochondrial nucleoids. However, TFAM does not affect the organization of mtDNA as observed in PHB1-knockdown cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PHB1 maintains the organization and copy number of the mtDNA through both TFAM-independent and -dependent pathways.},
