	abstract = {We compare methods for filtering RNA-seq lowexpression genes and investigate the effect of filtering on detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Although RNA-seq technology has improved the dynamic range of gene expression quantification, low-expression genes may be indistinguishable from sampling noise. The presence of noisy, low-expression genes can decrease the sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus, identification and filtering of these low-expression genes may improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the SEQC benchmark dataset, we investigate the effect of different filtering methods on DEG detection sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect of RNA-seq pipelines on optimal filtering thresholds. Results indicate that the filtering threshold that maximizes the total number of DEGs closely corresponds to the threshold that maximizes DEG detection sensitivity. Transcriptome reference annotation, expression quantification method, and DEG detection method are statistically significant RNA-seq pipeline factors that affect the optimal filtering threshold.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition which is characterized by irreversible airway obstruction due to narrowing of small airways, bronchiolitis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma, emphysema. It is the fourth most common cause of mortality in the world and is expected to be the third most common cause of death by 2020. The main cause of COPD is smoking but other exposures may be of importance. Exposure leads to airway inflammation in which a variety of cells are involved. Besides neutrophil granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, airway epithelial cells are also of particular importance in the inflammatory process and in the development of emphysema. Cell trafficking orchestrated by chemokines and other chamoattractants, the proteinase–antiproteinase system, oxidative stress and airway remodelling are central processes associated with the development of COPD. Recently systemic effects of COPD have attracted attention and the importance of systemic inflammation has been recognized. This seems to have direct therapeutic implications as treatment with inhaled glucocorticosteroids has been shown to influence mortality. The increasing body of knowledge regarding the inflammatory mechanism in COPD will most likely have implications for future therapy and new drugs, specifically aimed at interaction with the inflammatory processes, are currently being developed.},

	abstract = {The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) comprise a family of at least 20 proteolytic enzymes that play an essential role in tissue remodeling. MMP1 (interstitial collagenase), MMP9 (gelatinase B) and MMP12 (macrophage elastase) are thought to be important in the development of emphysema. A number of naturally occurring polymorphisms of human MMP gene promoters have been identified and found to alter transcriptional activity. Additionally, we detected a novel polymorphism in the MMP12 coding region (Asn357Ser). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MMP polymorphisms in the development of chronic obstructive lung disease. We determined the prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers chosen from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, Lung Health Study for having the fastest (n = 284) and slowest (n = 306) 5 year rate of decline of lung function. Of the five polymorphisms, only G–1607GG was associated with a rate of decline in lung function. The –1607GG allele was negatively associated with a fast rate of decline (P = 0.02). However, haplotypes consisting of alleles from the MMP1 G–1607GG and MMP12 Asn357Ser polymorphisms were associated with rate of decline of lung function (P = 0.0007). These data suggest that polymorphisms in the MMP1 and MMP12 genes, but not MMP9, are either causative factors in smoking-related lung injury or are in linkage disequilibrium with causative polymorphisms.},

In this study, we clarified a novel mitochondrial function of PHB1 that regulates the organization and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In PHB1-knockdown cells, we found that mtDNA is not stained by fluorescent dyes, such as ethidium bromide and PicoGreen, although the mitochondrial membrane potential still maintains. We also demonstrated that mtDNA, which is predominantly found in the NP-40-insoluble fraction when isolated from normal mitochondria, is partially released into the soluble fraction when isolated from PHB1knockdown cells, indicating that the organization of the mitochondrial nucleoids has been altered. Furthermore, we found that PHB1 regulates copy number of mtDNA by stabilizing TFAM protein, a known protein component of the mitochondrial nucleoids. However, TFAM does not affect the organization of mtDNA as observed in PHB1-knockdown cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PHB1 maintains the organization and copy number of the mtDNA through both TFAM-independent and -dependent pathways.},

	abstract = {Background
Inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mitochondrial oxidative stress might be involved in driving the oxidative stress–induced pathology.

Objective
We sought to determine the effects of oxidative stress on mitochondrial function in the pathophysiology of airway inflammation in ozone-exposed mice and human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells.

Methods
Mice were exposed to ozone, and lung inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and mitochondrial function were determined. Human ASM cells were isolated from bronchial biopsy specimens from healthy subjects, smokers, and patients with COPD. Inflammation and mitochondrial function in mice and human ASM cells were measured with and without the presence of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ.

Results
Mice exposed to ozone, a source of oxidative stress, had lung inflammation and AHR associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and reflected by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, and reduced mitochondrial complex I, III, and V expression. Reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction by the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ reduced inflammation and AHR. ASM cells from patients with COPD have reduced ΔΨm, adenosine triphosphate content, complex expression, basal and maximum respiration levels, and respiratory reserve capacity compared with those from healthy control subjects, whereas mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were increased. Healthy smokers were intermediate between healthy nonsmokers and patients with COPD. Hydrogen peroxide induced mitochondrial dysfunction in ASM cells from healthy subjects. MitoQ and Tiron inhibited TGF-β–induced ASM cell proliferation and CXCL8 release.

Conclusions
Mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with COPD is associated with excessive mitochondrial ROS levels, which contribute to enhanced inflammation and cell hyperproliferation. Targeting mitochondrial ROS represents a promising therapeutic approach in patients with COPD.},

	abstract = {Most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exhibit characteristics of airway mucus hypersecretion, namely sputum production, increased luminal mucus, submucosal gland hypertrophy and goblet cell hyperplasia. The clinical consequences of hypersecretion are impaired gas exchange and compromised mucociliary clearance, which encourages bacterial colonization and associated exacerbations. However, the extent of the contribution of mucus to pathophysiology of COPD is controversial. Early epidemiological studies found little evidence for the involvement of mucus in the age-related decline in lung function and mortality associated with COPD and concluded that chronic air£ow obstruction and mucus hypersecretion were independent processes. Later studies found positive associations between phlegm production and decline in lung function, hospitalization and death. Thus, although not diagnostic for the condition, mucus hypersecretion contributes to morbidity and mortality in certain groups of patients with COPD. This suggests that it is important to develop drugs that inhibit mucus hypersecretion in these patients. Unfortunately, ambiguity in clinical studies of mucoactive drugs means that mucolytics are not recommended in clinical management. Future research should determine whether there is an intrinsic abnormality in mucus in COPD, which will determine development of appropriate inhibitors, which in turn can be used in ‘proof of concept’ and in treatment.},
